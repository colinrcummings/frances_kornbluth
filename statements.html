          <p>“My art reflects a philosophy of openness and trust in my life. My growth as an artist has come about from being open to experience and the world around me, as well as from sharing the rich heritage of artists of the past.</p>
          <p>Creating forms with a minimum of preconception has been a driving force throughout my adult life. Using criteria based on values learned through formal education and, increasingly, on intuition, I have learned to trust my judgment and honor the hidden meanings of what often appears to be accidental.</p>
          <p>Time has been an important factor in the working process―knowing when to set a piece aside as the flow of energy and ideas diminishes and having the patience to wait for solutions to technical problems that I myself have created. I have gained the perspective to recognize what appears to be unfamiliar and new on the canvas and relate that to artistic expression of other times and places, incorporating it into a language of my own.</p>
          <p>Though I am constantly fed by other disciplines such as music, film and literature, the natural environment has been my primary source. The rich stimulation provided by northeastern Connecticut and by Monhegan Island, Maine, where I have summered for the past four decades, has allowed me to go beyond visual 'scenery' to create a broader synthesis using all my senses. Through discovering metaphors in the landscape, connecting many different aspects of experience, and bringing these perceptions to the studio, I have been able to make order of the chaos that impacts and pervades life at this time.”</p>

          <p>“The natural environment has been my ongoing sense of imagery and inspiration. Over the years, working in different mediums and at various sites in my studio on Monhegan Island, Maine, and rural northeastern Connecticut, I developed a visual vocabulary of form, shape and color that expresses my personal vision along with the intensity of my feelings about the landscape and art. It is important that my paintings resonate in terms of my individuality, the tradition of art and artists from which I follow and the time in which each work is created."</p>

          <p>“In my art I define and redefine landscape, arriving at abstractions of the natural and man-made environment. My vocabulary of shapes and forms has developed over the years. In recent years, due to a gradual loss of vision, it has become necessary to limit my palette to black and white. Being both observer and participant in rural northeast Connecticut and on a remote island off the coast of Maine, I am constantly challenged to make order out of the impact and complexity of what I know and what I constantly discover. I have been recording and communicating a continuum concerned with the natural order of things, in a realm where details have a life of their own and often dictate new patterns that expand meaning and the boundaries of personal experience."</p>
